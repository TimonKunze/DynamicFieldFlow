In essence, you are allowed to use, distribute, and share the original code, and you are allowed to make changes to the
code, but you are (for the time being) not allowed to publish altered versions of the code. You are, however, invited to
contribute your changes to the original code base by filing a pull request.

DFF will be released under the LGPL3 once the code base is sufficiently stable to prevent early forks that are not in
line with the author's intentions and might cause incompatibilities between models implemented using different forks of
DFF.

Exemptions from the rule that altered versions of the code may not be published can be requested by contacting Daniel
Sabinasz (daniel.sabinasz@ini.rub.de) personally and describing one's intentions for the fork.
